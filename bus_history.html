        <h2 class="heading">Team History</h2>
        <p>The mid 80's was a great time to be a gamer. Consoles were showing up in people's homes at unprecedented rates and we were already a decade into the wonders of "The Oregon Trail". A great time to be alive. It was during this time that the founding member of the n00b_Skoolbus came into being. He seemed a normal child of Humboldt at first, but just one year after his birth, in 1985, something came to America that would change his life forever. The NES.</p>

            <figcaption>The NES in all its glory.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As soon as he could hold a controller the Nintendo Entertainment System would dominate his life. Long innings of R.B.I. Baseball and endless deaths in Battletoads would forge his soul in red hot 8-bit fires. Although he would not adpot the moniker until years later, by the turn of the century Svenzor had emerged. </p>
        <p>Svenzor had earned the heart of a gamer, but one man a team does not make, and it would be years until he would meet his second in command. One day at a small Northern California Community College, history would be made and Death Heim was recruited to the cause. A brutal strategist, Death Heim introduced Svenzor to competative <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr> games like Halo: Combat Evolved and Myst.</p>
        <p> Since then the n00b_Skoolbus has grown to nearly twice its size, more recently adding the fierce competative Sims 3 phenom RawrImmaZombie and the Bus' resident trolling expert and <abbr title="Counter Strike">CS</abbr> tactician Staberama.
